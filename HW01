Ex1 solution : 
1. Inspect the login page http://com402.epfl.ch/hw1/ex1 and see the script. In the script one can see that the variable enc :  var enc = superencryption(username,mySecureOneTimePad) must be equal to password to successfully login. 
2. Get the value generated by superencryption and then enter the same in the password field for successful login. 

Ex2 Solution : 
http://com402.epfl.ch/hw1/ex2/login tracks people. This is the clue that they would have a cookie !! Maybe cookie gives some hints on how to proceed. The cookie is "a2VzaGF2LnNpbmdoQGVwZmwuY2gsMTU1MjQyOTg2Nixjb200MDIsaHcxLGV4MSx1c2Vy" in base64, changing it to UTF-8 gives : keshav.singh@epfl.ch,1552429866,com402,hw1,ex1,user : so one of this value should be the one we could change to get past security. Most likely it is user which should be changed to admin . I tried with admin and it failed, and with administrator and changing the LoginCookie of the application to : "a2VzaGF2LnNpbmdoQGVwZmwuY2gsMTU1MjQyOTg2Nixjb200MDIsaHcxLGV4MSxhZG1pbmlzdHJhdG9y" made the login attempt as superuser successful.
